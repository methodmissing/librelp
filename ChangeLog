Version 1.0.0 (rgerhards), 2009-12-11
This version of librelp matured in practice and it is not time for
a 1.0 release. Besides that, it includes a small number of
changes:
- bugfix: user callback never received remote IP address
- bugfix: offers builder did use a fixed size string without bounds
  checking. I don't think this was a real issue as it was not
  exposed to the outside world, but now the buffer dynamically
  grows (which is the right thing to do). Thank to mterry for alerting
  me.

Version 0.1.3 (rgerhards), 2009-02-10
- the callback on message reception did not contain a way to pass on
  a caller cookie (e.g. for an instance pointer). An additional
  interface has been added to support that.
- cleaned up FDL license specifics
- added libtool versioning
- made librelp compile out of the box on FreeBSD - thanks to Michael
  Biebl for the patch
